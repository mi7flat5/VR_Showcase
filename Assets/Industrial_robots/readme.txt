This package contains 4 different types of high-detail industrial robots.

Just drag the prefab into your scene and arrange them as you like.

You may also want to have a look at the example scene that contains all the prefabs.

Each single robot is fully animateable and uses about 8500 polygons.

One single textures with a size of 2048x2048 is used.

The original FBX-file is also included in the package.

 
How to animate the objects:
---------------------------
Please notice:
-Use only the "rotation_axis" objects to rotate any component of the robots
-Rotation can only be change correctly in Game-View or using a script.
 Otherwise the rotation will not be done around the correct rotation axis
 of the single parts. Instead all parts from the selected one will be 
 rotated around the bounding box center of of objects in the hierarchy below
 including the selected object.
